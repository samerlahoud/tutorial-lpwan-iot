### Conclusions (1/3)
<!--
- What are the requirements and characteristics of mMTC in 5G?
    - Devices function for many years on a single battery charge
    - Devices communicate from locations where shadowing and path loss would limit the usefulness of more traditional cellular technologies
    - High density of connections at low data rates?
    - Latency?
-->
- How do NB-IoT meet the 5G mMTC requirements?
    - Complexity: short messages, low complexity codes and modulations
    - Coverage: Low receiver sensitivity
    - Energy: Optimized reachability and reduced signaling
    - Capacity: Multi-tone and single-tone transmissions
    - Cost: Reused architecture

### Conclusions (2/3) 
- How do we evaluate the performance of an NB-IoT deployment in terms of coverage and capacity?
    - Combination of link-level and system-level performance evaluation: assess the impact of physical-layer techniques (CE, repetitions, MCS, transmission formats...) on NB-IoT performance
    - Link adaption enables to tune radio parameters (repetitions, MCS, and transmission format) in order to combat harsh radio conditions and maximize data rates

#### Global performance
- No coverage outage for a cell radius of 4 km in outdoor urban environment
- 200 000 devices sending 5 packets per hour

### Conclusions (3/3)
- What are the challenges for optimizing the performance of NB-IoT?
    - Adaptation of the radio propagation models
    - Interference mitigation
    - Link adaptation and resource allocation
    - Support for quality of service such as delay bounded transmission
    - Energy efficiency maximization and power management
