### Conclusions (1/3)
- What are the requirements and characteristics of mMTC in 5G?
    - Devices function for many years on a single battery charge
    - Devices communicate from locations where shadowing and path loss would limit the usefulness of more traditional cellular technologies
    - High density of connections at low data rates?
    - Latency?
- How do NB-IoT meet the 5G mMTC requirements?
    - Short messages, low complexity codes and modulations
    - Low receiver sensitivity
    - Optimized reachability and reduced signaling
    - Multi-tone and single-tone transmissions
    - Reused architecture

### Conclusions (2/3)
- How do we evaluate the performance of an NB-IoT deployment in terms of coverage and capacity?
    - Link-level performance evaluation: assess the impact of physical-layer techniques (CE, repetitions, MCS, transmission formats...) on NB-IoT performance
    - System-level performance evaluation: ... Performance evaluations should take into account collisions and duty cycle in LoRaWAN, scheduling and signaling in NB-IoT

#### Global performance
- LoRaWAN shows coverage limitations compared to NB-IoT especially in indoor dense urban environments
- Collisions hinder the performance of LoRaWAN in heavy loaded networks

### Conclusions (3/3)
- What are the challenges for optimizing the performance of NB-IoT?
    - Adapation of the radio propagation models
    - Interference mitigation
    - Link adaptation and resource allocation
    - Support for quality of service such as delay bounded transmission
    - Energy efficiency maximization and power management
