## Analyzing the Limits of LoRaWAN
### Research Approaches for Analyzing LoRaWAN
- The research studies analyze the performance of LoRaWAN networks considering different criteria:
    - Capacity
    - Coverage
    - Energy
    - Delay
    - Fairness
- The research studies use different methods to obtain the performance results:
    - Simulation
    - Mathematical modeling
    - Measurement campaigns

### Capacity Simulation of a LoRaWAN Network
- Simulation of LoRaWAN physical and MAC layers developed in ns-3\footnote{Van den Abeele, Floris, et al. "Scalability analysis of large-scale LoRaWAN networks in ns-3." IEEE Internet of Things Journal 4.6 (2017): 2186-2198.}
- Computation of the Bit Error Rate (BER) for different LoRa PHY configurations over a complex AWGN channel: $\log_{10}(BER(SNR)) = \alpha\exp(\beta SNR)$
- Implementation of the MAC layer and basic functions of network elements (class A end-devices, gateway, network server)
