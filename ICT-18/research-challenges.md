## Analyzing the Limits of LoRaWAN
### Research Approaches for Analyzing LoRaWAN
- The research studies analyze the performance of LoRaWAN networks considering different criteria:
    - Capacity
    - Coverage
    - Energy
    - Delay
    - Fairness
- The research studies use different methods to obtain the performance results:
    - Simulation
    - Mathematical modeling
    - Measurement campaigns

### Simulation of the LoRa Bit Error Rate\footnote{Van den Abeele, Floris, et al. "Scalability analysis of large-scale LoRaWAN networks in ns-3." IEEE Internet of Things Journal 4.6 (2017)}

- Implementation of the LoRa physical layer in ns-3

### Basic Assignment of Spreading Factors\footnote{Van den Abeele, Floris, et al. "Scalability analysis of large-scale LoRaWAN networks in ns-3." IEEE Internet of Things Journal 4.6 (2017)}
- Assigning spreading factors based on a packet error ratio threshold gives the highest Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)
- However, this basic assignment leads to unfairness between end-devices using different spreading factors

### Fair Assignment of Spreading Factors\footnote{Reynders, Brecht, Wannes Meert, and Sofie Pollin. "Power and spreading factor control in low power wide area networks." 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) (2017)}
- Fairness is achieved by minimizing the maximum collision on spreading factors: $\min \underset{s}{\max}\ p_{coll,s}$
    - The minimum is reached for a fraction $p_s$ of end-devices using spreading factor $s$ given by $p_s =\frac{s}{2^s}/\sum_{i=7}^{12} \frac{i}{2i}$
- Fairness does not hinder the data extraction rate DER (the ratio of received packets to transmitted packets over a period of time)

### Impact of Confirmed Messages\footnote{Van den Abeele, Floris, et al. "Scalability analysis of large-scale LoRaWAN networks in ns-3." IEEE Internet of Things Journal 4.6 (2017)}
- Repeating unconfirmed messages or using confirmed mode increases the PDR only when the traffic load is very low
- For high traffic load, the PDR of confirmed mode is limited by the duty cycle and half-duplex transmission

### Measurement of the Capture Effect\footnote{Bor, Martin C., et al. "Do LoRa low-power wide-area networks scale?." Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems. ACM (2016)}
- Experimentation (55.25 symbols packet length) shows the packet reception rate as function of transmission offset relative to the weak node in symbols
- A strong transmission can be successfully decoded when it arrives one packet time early up to at most 3 symbols late
- Capture model integrated in a discrete-event simulator (LoRaSim)

### Energy Model for LoRaWAN Devices\footnote{Casals, Llu√≠s, et al. "Modeling the Energy Performance of LoRaWAN." Sensors 17.10 (2017)}
- Model the current consumption of different LoRaWAN end-devices
    - Identify the different states of the end-device, and measure the respective current consumption and duration (*e.g.,* wake up, transmission, receive window, sleep)
- Example of using the model: collisions increase the energy required per delivered payload bit especially for confirmed mode

### Model for the Macro-Diversity Gain\footnote{Song, Qipeng, Xavier Lagrange, and Loutfi Nuaymi. "Evaluation of Macro Diversity Gain in Long Range ALOHA Networks." IEEE Communications Letters 21.11 (2017)}
- End-device and gateway positions form a stationary Poisson point process with spatial density $\lambda_m$ and $\lambda_b$, respectively
- The spatial density of end-devices that are transmitting a packet is $p\lambda_m$
- The transmit success probability is defined as
$$p_s = \mathbb{P} \{SINR = \frac{P_r}{I+N} \approx \frac{P_r}{I} \geq \theta\}$$
- With macro reception diversity, the transmission fails if and only if none of the gateways has received the packet
- Let $\gamma$ be the path-loss exponent, $H$ an exponentially distributed random variable with unit mean, $\chi$ a zero-mean Gaussian r.v. with variance $\sigma^2$, the network packet loss rate $P_f$ can be written as:
$$P_f = \exp\left( - \frac{\lambda_b}{A\theta^\frac{2}{\gamma} p \lambda_m} \right)$$

<!--
$$p_s(r) = \mathbb{E}_\chi \left[ \exp(-p \lambda_m \pi A\theta^{\frac{2}{\gamma}} e^{\frac{2\sigma^2}{\gamma^2}}r^2e^{-\frac{2}{\gamma}\chi})\right]$$
-->

### Evaluation of Macro-Diversity\footnote{Song, Qipeng, Xavier Lagrange, and Loutfi Nuaymi. "Evaluation of Macro Diversity Gain in Long Range ALOHA Networks." IEEE Communications Letters 21.11 (2017)}
- Macro diversity leads to lower packet loss rate than the cases where the end-device attaches to the nearest gateway or to the gateway corresponding to the strongest received power

### Model for the Coexistence of LoRa with Other Technologies\footnote{Qin, Zhijin, et al. "Modelling and analysis of low-power wide-area networks." IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) (2017)}
- Coexistence of LoRa and non-LoRa nodes
    - LoRa nodes position form a Matern cluster process (PPP cluster center is formed by LoRa gateways and the end-devices in each cluster form the children process)
    - Non-LoRa nodes are modelled as PPP
- In the SINR expression, interference is the sum of three terms: intra-cluster, inter-cluster, and coexistence

\end{figure}

### Coverage of LoRa with Coexisting Technologies\footnote{Qin, Zhijin, et al. "Modelling and analysis of low-power wide-area networks." IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) (2017)}
- The coverage probability monotonically decreases with the density of gateways and non LoRa nodes
