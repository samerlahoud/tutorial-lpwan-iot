### Conclusions (1/4)
- How do LoRaWAN and NB-IoT meet the LPWAN requirements?
    - Complexity: short messages, simple channel codes, and low-complexity modulations
    - Coverage: low receiver sensitivity
    - Energy consumption: optimized device reachability and data transmission
    - Capacity: multiple transmissions on the same channel
    - Simplified network topology and deployment

### Conclusions (2/3)
- How do we evaluate the performance of a LoRaWAN and NB-IoT deployment in terms of coverage and capacity?
    - Combination of simulation, mathematical modeling and measurement campaigns
    - Performance evaluations should take into account collisions and duty cycle in LoRaWAN, scheduling and signaling in NB-IoT

#### Typical performance
- LoRaWAN shows coverage limitations, in comparison with NB-IoT, especially in indoor dense urban environments
- NB-IoT shows no coverage outage for a 4 km cell radius in indoor dense urban environments
- In order to maximize data rates, multi-tone transmissions are preferred for good radio conditions, while single-tone transmissions enable to combat harsh conditions
- Collisions hinder the performance of LoRaWAN in heavy loaded networks
- The capacity of an NB-IoT deployment can scale up to 200 000 devices sending 5 packets per hour

### Conclusions (3/3)
- What are the challenges for optimizing the performance of LoRaWAN and NB-IoT?
    - Adaptation of the radio propagation models
    - Adaptive channel access
    - Interference mitigation
    - Link adaptation and resource allocation
    - Support for quality of service such as delay-bounded transmissions
    - Energy efficiency maximization and power management
